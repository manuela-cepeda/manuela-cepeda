👋 Hi, I’m @manuela-cepeda. I am a 29 years old Front-End developer based in Rosario, Argentina.

🌱My interest in sofware development started back when I used to work as an architect (the ones that design houses) and I started making my owns plugins with C# to automate and extend the capabilities of diferent softwares (just for the fun of it). Fast-forward to today, I’ve worked in different types of organizations (start-ups and large corporations) mostly as a React Developer.


💞️ I am passionate about coding and solving problems through code, and I am excited to work alongside other amazing programmers and learn so much more!


💻 Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

✨ JavaScript (ES6+)
✨ TypeScript
✨ Sass
✨ React.js
✨ Express
✨ Node.js
✨ Mongo
✨ Firebase
